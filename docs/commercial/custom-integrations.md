## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can you migrate while we continue using our current provider?**
A: Yes! We support parallel operation during migration. New transactions can flow through both systems until cutover.

**Q: Do you handle PCI compliance for migrations?**
A: Our migration process is PCI-compliant. Card data is transferred using secure, tokenized methods. We never store raw card numbers.

**Q: What if our migration is more complex than estimated?**
A: Fixed-price projects include a contingency. If scope changes significantly, we'll discuss before proceeding and provide revised estimates.

**Q: Can we pause a project?**
A: Yes, with at least 2 weeks notice. Projects can be paused for up to 60 days. Extended pauses may require re-scoping.

**Q: Do you provide post-migration support?**
A: All projects include 30-day warranty support. Extended support is available through our Support Tiers.
